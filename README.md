Created an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize key HR metrics, including Employee Count, Attrition Rate, Average Age, and Attrition by Gender and Department.

The dashboard also includes insights into employee distribution by age group, job satisfaction ratings, and attrition rates across education fields and age groups, enabling informed HR decision-making.
